## YYYY-MM-DD
- Note:
## 2026-01-23
- Note: Dragon Mount (free adjacency move) should use click-to-move only for MVP; keyboard directional input is path-bound and should not control Dragon movement.
## 2026-01-24
- Note: Player deck/hand/discard moved under state.player.* for multiplayer-ready structure; core rules now read/write from player.

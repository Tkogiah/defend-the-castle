# Merchant Card Proposal Review (Claude List)

Rating scale: 1–10 (10 = strongest/most desirable). Ordered best → worst.

1) **Whirlwind** — *9.5/10*  
**Confirmed spec:** 15g. Until end of turn, whenever you spend an **attack point**, that attack also hits **all enemies within range 1** of your current hex. **Stacking:** each additional Whirlwind played adds **+1 AoE damage** (AoE only).  
AoE melee at range 1 is universally useful, clean to understand, and plugs into existing combat without new rules. High impact without breaking economy pacing.

2) **Ambush** — *9/10*  
Double damage on next attack is a classic burst tool, exciting for boss turns and simple to implement. Strong but bounded by attack timing.

3) **Haste Potion** — *8.5/10*  
+2 move and +1 attack in one card delivers flexible tempo in a single turn. Good feel, moderate power, no new rules.

4) **Quickdraw** — *8.5/10*  
Immediate draw 2 smooths bad hands and fuels combo turns. Clean, always useful, no rules risk.

5) **Overcharge** — *8.5/10*  
Amplifies Action cards into a mini‑combo piece without adding new systems. Creates interesting sequencing and rewards planning.

6) **Treasure Map** — *8/10*  
Double crystals on next kill is a strong economy spike tied to combat. Encourages risky positioning and smart timing.

7) **Snipe** — *8/10*  
+3 range for a single attack is crisp, tactical, and solves “out of reach” turns. Potent but not overwhelming.

8) **Tactician** — *8/10*  
Top‑deck reorder improves consistency and reduces dead turns; feels smart and strategic. Requires minor new rule but low risk.

9) **Focus** — *8/10*  
Full hand refresh is a big swing that can save bad draws and enable big turns. Very desirable with clear use case.

10) **Bounty Hunter** — *8/10*  
Boss‑killer specialization is dramatic and clean. Great for spike turns without affecting regular combat too much.

11) **Gold Rush** — *7.5/10*  
Double conversion at center creates a memorable “cash‑in” moment. Works well with existing economy loop.

12) **Chain Lightning** — *7.5/10*  
Splash damage is compelling and distinct from Whirlwind. Needs new rule but still clear and impactful.

13) **Earthquake** — *7.5/10*  
Ring‑wide damage is powerful and thematic; can be exciting in crowded waves. Might need tuning to avoid trivializing late waves.

14) **Flanking Strike** — *7.5/10*  
Rewards move‑then‑attack pattern already present. Feels good and creates tactical movement incentives.

15) **Toll Collector** — *7/10*  
Crystal gain without attack provides a safety valve for empty turns. Useful economy lever with low complexity.

16) **Siphon** — *7/10*  
Gold from damage merges economy with combat. It’s strong but still bounded by attack points.

17) **Sprint** — *7/10*  
Pure repositioning is sometimes essential and creates high‑tempo turns. Straightforward, but narrow in combat.

18) **Rally** — *7/10*  
Simple global attack buff; in solo it’s just +1 but still useful. Scales well with future co‑op.

19) **Supply Line** — *7/10*  
Multi‑turn draw is very attractive and feels like a reward. Needs new persistent effect, but payoff is clear.

20) **Harvest** — *7/10*  
Rewards risky positioning with crystal gain. Interesting but can be swingy depending on enemy clustering.

21) **Detonate** — *7/10*  
Converts crystals into burst damage; creates real trade‑offs. Solid mid‑tier power.

22) **Scout** — *6.5/10*  
Intel on enemy movement is useful, but less exciting than power spikes. Great for players who like planning.

23) **Repel** — *6.5/10*  
Pushback control is helpful and tactically rich but requires new rules. Can reduce tension if too strong.

24) **Shockwave** — *6.5/10*  
AoE pushback + damage is attractive but rules complexity rises. Balancing is sensitive.

25) **Counterstrike** — *6.5/10*  
Reactive attack is cool but adds timing complexity. Could be strong if triggered often.

26) **Sentry** — *6.5/10*  
End‑of‑turn auto attack feels strong and flavorful. Needs new timing rules, but gameplay value is clear.

27) **Hamstring** — *6.5/10*  
Movement debuff is a useful alternative to freeze. Requires new rule but fits the tactical toolkit.

28) **Merchant’s Favor** — *6.5/10*  
Discount is always nice and helps afford rare cards. Less exciting in moment‑to‑moment play.

29) **Salvage** — *6/10*  
Destroy crystal to draw 2 is interesting but might fight against economy loop. New rule (destroy) adds friction.

30) **Reforge** — *6/10*  
Deck‑thinning is powerful long‑term but can feel “meta.” Also needs permanent removal rule.

31) **Vault** — *6/10*  
Remote conversion is strong but undermines the center loop. Powerful, but risks flattening strategy.

32) **Recall** — *6/10*  
Teleport to center is dramatic and useful, but bypasses traversal and tension. Could be too strong situationally.

33) **Trailblaze** — *6/10*  
Free movement breaks core path rule for a turn; exciting but large design exception. Needs careful guardrails.

34) **Fortify** — *6/10*  
Knockout immunity + pushback is very strong but rule‑heavy. Could trivialize danger if common.

35) **Mend Armor** — *5.5/10*  
Damage reduction is straightforward but relies on a damage model that isn’t central yet. Might feel abstract.

36) **Anchor** — *5.5/10*  
Collision damage and immunity create complex edge cases. Fun tank fantasy but heavy rules overhead.

37) **Fade** — *5.5/10*  
Full invulnerability is powerful but can erase tension. Needs careful rarity or constraints.

38) **Parry** — *5.5/10*  
Death‑prevention + teleport is strong, but presumes HP and creates extra rule branches.

39) **Beacon** — *5.5/10*  
Enemy pull is flashy but adds new movement logic. Might clash with pathing expectations.

40) **Decoy** — *5/10*  
Cool concept but requires new entity rules and targeting logic. Useful, but implementation cost is high.

41) **Mirror Image** — *5/10*  
Copying last card adds tracking complexity. Powerful, but meta‑rules heavy for MVP.

42) **Pickpocket** — *5/10*  
Free random merchant card is fun but disrupts shop economy. Needs new pool draw rules.

43) **Invest** — *5/10*  
Delayed gold is thematic but adds bookkeeping; payoff might feel slow in short MVP runs.

44) **Double or Nothing** — *4.5/10*  
RNG swing is exciting but can feel unfair or frustrating. Needs RNG rule.

45) **War Cry** — *4.5/10*  
Armor ignore has no current target. Feels dead until armored enemies exist.

46) **Leech** — *4/10*  
Castle HP healing depends on a system not in MVP. Hard to justify now.

47) **Crystal Shield** — *4/10*  
Death prevention uses HP framing and adds new rule paths. Benefit overlaps with Fortify/Parry.

48) **Tactician** — *3.5/10*  
If deck peek is too weak vs other options, may not feel worth buying. (Keep if you want deck‑skill expression.)

49) **Barricade** — *3.5/10*  
Barrier hex state is a big new system for a narrow effect. Costs complexity for limited payoff.

50) **Fade** — *3/10*  
Full stealth/invulnerability can trivialize danger; high balance risk and rule overhead.

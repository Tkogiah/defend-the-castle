# Post‑MVP Ideas — Video‑Game‑Specific Modifications

Source: Claude response (2026‑01‑30). Saved for later exploration.

## 1) Real‑time tension within turn structure
- Optional turn timer with enemy telegraph animations + visible countdown.
- Within‑hex movement feel (already on roadmap) to add micro‑positioning.
- Enemy “charge‑up” reactions during player turn for tension without rule changes.

## 2) Hidden information / fog of war
- Hide enemy spawns until in visible range.
- Obscure enemy HP or movement rolls until scouted.
- Make outer rings riskier by default through uncertainty.

## 3) Dynamic board state
- Terrain modifiers that change per wave (ice slow, fire damage, crystal‑rich).
- Hex destruction or boss attacks that remove path segments.
- Environmental hazards that activate on specific turns/rings.

## 4) Meta‑progression across runs
- Unlockable gear/cards added to pool via milestones.
- Class unlocks via challenge conditions.
- Castle upgrades between runs (defense, starting gear, etc.).

## 5) Scaling difficulty and procedural variety
- Dynamic enemy scaling per wave.
- New enemy abilities introduced later (ranged, flying, shielded).
- Procedural variation in merchant selection and boss loot tables.

## 6) Audio/visual feedback as mechanics
- Screen shake, card‑play animation, death particles.
- Audio cues for threat states (heartbeat near center).
- Music stingers for wave clear / boss phase changes.

### De‑prioritize
- Heavy narrative. If any, keep it lightweight: short lore snippets on gear/cards, one‑line boss intros.

# Additional Ideas (Codex)

## A) “Pressure Clock” enemy phase
- Enemies gain +1 movement every N turns unless you defeat a miniboss or clear a side objective.
- Keeps pacing tight without changing core rules.

## B) Zone control rewards
- Holding a ring for a full turn grants a temporary buff (move/attack/econ). 
- Encourages choosing a front line instead of constant retreating.

## C) Dynamic merchant stock events
- Mid‑wave merchant caravan spawns on a ring for 1 turn only.
- Creates risk‑reward detours without touching core economy.

## D) Boss mutations per run
- Bosses roll 1–2 “mutators” (extra armor, double move every 3 turns, spawns adds).
- Keeps boss fights fresh without new content.

## E) Hex anomalies
- Rare hexes that flip effects when stepped on (swap attack/move for a turn, add a crystal, etc.).
- Simple to implement as tile modifiers later.

## F) Limited scouting tools
- Consumable “Scout” cards that reveal a ring’s enemy rolls for 1 turn.
- Works with fog‑of‑war while keeping player agency.

## G) Rhythm turn
- Optional “perfect timing” windows during animations grant +1 move/attack.
- Adds light skill expression while keeping turn structure.


## H) Speed‑play bonus
- If the player ends their turn within a time threshold, draw +1 card next turn.
- Rewards quick thinking without changing core rules (optional toggle for accessibility).

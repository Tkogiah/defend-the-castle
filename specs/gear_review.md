# Gear Proposal Review (Claude List)

Rating scale: 1–10 (10 = strongest/most desirable). Each slot ordered best → worst.

---

## Head (9)

1) **Circlet of Greed** — *9.5/10*  
Draw 6 per turn is massive consistency and power. Strong in every game state and doesn’t add rules complexity.

2) **Astral Lens** — *9/10*  
+2 range permanently is a huge safety and damage boost. It changes positioning rules in a satisfying way without new systems.

3) **War Horn** — *8.5/10*  
Once‑per‑turn ring AoE is big board impact tied to positioning. Powerful and intuitive.

4) **Crown of Foresight** — *8/10*  
Perfect information on enemy movement is extremely valuable for planning. High strategic power with low complexity.

5) **Helmet of Echoes** — *8/10*  
First card doubled per turn is exciting and high‑impact. Very strong but adds rule complexity around duplication.

6) **Fireball** — *7.5/10*  
High‑impact AoE is always useful, but it’s already known and might be outshined by some permanent boosts.

7) **Helm of the Tactician** — *7/10*  
Top‑deck reorder is strong for skilled play, but requires new rule plumbing and is less viscerally powerful.

8) **Mind Spike** — *6.5/10*  
Targeted freeze without attack is good control, but it adds a special case and overlaps with existing freeze concepts.

9) **Witch’s Hat** — *6/10*  
Copying discard effects is flexible but very rules‑heavy and can be swingy depending on your card pool.

## Body (9)

1) **King’s Purse** — *9.5/10*  
Bypasses the center loop entirely for gold. Massive economy acceleration and very desirable.

2) **Alchemist’s Coat** — *9/10*  
Doubling crystal conversion at center creates huge payout turns while preserving the “return to center” loop.

3) **Crystal Armor** — *8.5/10*  
Turns dead economy cards into damage, smoothing turns and rewarding risky farming. Strong and clean.

4) **Robe of Fortune** — *8/10*  
Passive +2 gold/turn is consistent and scales with time. Always useful with no extra rules.

5) **Berserker’s Hide** — *7.5/10*  
Adjacency damage scaling is powerful and encourages risk. Can be very strong in dense waves.

6) **Merchant’s Vest** — *7/10*  
Discounted buying is valuable but indirect. Strong in longer runs, less exciting moment‑to‑moment.

7) **Aegis Mantle** — *6.5/10*  
Once‑per‑turn collision negate is powerful defense, but adds rule complexity and can reduce tension.

8) **Platemail of the Sentinel** — *6/10*  
Collision immunity is extremely strong but changes core loss conditions; heavy rules impact.

9) **Cloak of Shadows** — *5.5/10*  
Full stealth bypasses enemy pathing and can trivialize risk. Big balance and rules cost.

## Hand (9)

1) **Power Glove** — *9.5/10*  
Double base damage is the purest power spike. Always desirable, no extra systems.

2) **Fist of the Colossus** — *9/10*  
Once‑per‑turn adjacent‑hex AoE nuke is huge and clear. Very satisfying and strong.

3) **Hammer of Shattering** — *8.5/10*  
Boss damage bonus makes boss turns feel great. Simple, impactful, and focused.

4) **Thief’s Gloves** — *8/10*  
Extra crystal drops per kill can snowball economy fast. Strong and exciting for aggressive play.

5) **Blade of the Wind** — *7.5/10*  
Passive cleave is a strong upgrade to attacks, but requires splash targeting logic.

6) **Gauntlet of Chains** — *7/10*  
Enemy pull enables tactical setups and AoE, but adds new movement rules.

7) **Shield of Reflection** — *6.5/10*  
Reactive damage during enemy phase is cool but adds timing complexity.

8) **Arcane Focus** — *6/10*  
Amplifying merchant card numbers is powerful but meta and adds rule branching.

9) **Vampiric Gauntlet** — *5.5/10*  
Healing the castle presumes a system not in MVP and reduces clarity right now.

## Foot (9)

1) **Sonic Boots** — *9.5/10*  
Double base movement is a massive power spike and universally useful.

2) **Featherstep** — *9/10*  
First two hexes free each turn is huge tempo and feels great immediately.

3) **Earthquake Stompers** — *8.5/10*  
Free AoE damage each turn is extremely strong and satisfying.

4) **Boots of the Merchant** — *8/10*  
Gold per move is steady and rewards activity. Strong over time.

5) **Ironclad Boots** — *7/10*  
Positional immunity is niche but strong as displacement mechanics grow.

6) **Winged Sandals** — *6.5/10*  
Free‑movement mini‑teleport each turn is powerful but breaks core path rules.

7) **Greaves of the Juggernaut** — *6/10*  
Damage on pass‑through is cool but requires new collision rules.

8) **Phantom Treads** — *5.5/10*  
Stealth + speed is strong but undermines pathing tension and needs new rules.

9) **Boots of the Collector** — *5/10*  
Depends on tracking kill hexes; effect is situational and bookkeeping‑heavy.

## Mount (9)

1) **War Horse** — *9/10*  
Move + damage combo is consistently strong and rewards good sequencing.

2) **Dire Wolf** — *8.5/10*  
Speed plus free bite damage every turn is powerful and simple.

3) **Siege Turtle** — *8/10*  
Big damage trade‑off is dramatic and clear. Very desirable for boss play.

4) **Dragon** — *7.5/10*  
Adjacency jump is strong and flexible, but outshined by more impactful mounts.

5) **Griffin** — *7/10*  
Range‑3 teleport is extremely strong but breaks the movement model and needs new rules.

6) **Wyvern** — *6.5/10*  
Ring‑wide repositioning is useful but needs special movement logic.

7) **Giant Eagle** — *6/10*  
Teleport to center is strong economy, but can flatten travel decisions.

8) **Nightmare Steed** — *5.5/10*  
Enemy slow aura is good control, but adds debuff rules and may be fiddly.

9) **Phoenix** — *5/10*  
Resurrection is dramatic but adds heavy rules and can reduce stakes.

# MVP Asset List — Questions (Draft)

Answer these to finalize the MVP asset list.

## 1) Tiles / Board
- Do you want **one base terrain** only (e.g., grass), or multiple (grass + stone + lava, etc.)?
- Do you want **edge/ring highlights** baked into the tile art or drawn by code?
- Do you want **path/rainbow gradient** still visible, or replaced by a different path indicator?

## 2) Units
Player:
- Style: humanoid, knight, mage, or abstract token?
- Facing: do we need 4 directions, 2 directions, or 1 (top‑down isometric)?
Enemies:
- How many **enemy looks** for MVP? (1, or 2–3 variants?)
Boss:
- Any specific look (dragon, giant, demon, etc.)?

## 3) UI / Cards
- Card frames: one frame reused for all, or different frames per card type (action, crystal, merchant)?
- Character sheet: do you want a themed frame or keep it minimal?
- Buttons: any specific style (pixel, medieval, clean)?

## 4) Effects / Overlays
- Attack range + movement range: should these be **pixel‑art effects** or still vector lines?
- Fireball / dragon overlays: keep as mesh lines or replace with sprite overlays?
- Hit / damage indicators: floating numbers or small effect sprites?

## 5) Animation
- How many frames for **walk**? (2, 4, 6)
- Do you want separate **attack** animations or just hit flashes?
- Do you want **death** animations (fade/shatter)?

## 6) Sound
- SFX: move, attack, hit, card play, enemy death, boss death, UI click — any others?
- Music: 1 loop — what vibe? (dark fantasy, chill tavern, epic battle)

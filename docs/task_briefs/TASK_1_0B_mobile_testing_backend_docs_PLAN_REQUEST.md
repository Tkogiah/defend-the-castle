# Task 1.0B Plan Request — Mobile Testing Backend (Docs)

## Goal
- Document local network, tunnel, and minimal deploy workflows for mobile testing.

## Context
- Depends on Task 1.0A code changes.
- Related docs:
  - /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/BACKEND_CONTEXT.md
  - /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/README.md

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Create `docs/MOBILE_TESTING.md` with local + tunnel steps.
  - Add pointers in README and BACKEND_CONTEXT.
  - Note limitations of tunnels.
- Out of scope:
  - Production deployment guides.

## Constraints
- MVP-first
- Keep docs short and actionable

## Risks / Unknowns
- Tunnel reliability varies; document limitations.

## Testing
- Not applicable (docs-only).

## Files (anticipated)
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/docs/MOBILE_TESTING.md
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/README.md
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/BACKEND_CONTEXT.md

## Success Criteria
- Clear mobile testing steps for local + tunnel.
- Minimal deploy path outlined without over-promising.

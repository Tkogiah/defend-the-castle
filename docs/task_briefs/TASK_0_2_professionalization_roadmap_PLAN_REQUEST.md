# Task 0.2 Plan Request — Professionalization Roadmap

## Goal
- Define a phased roadmap that professionalizes the repo (docs, testing, CI, workflow, backend readiness) without changing MVP architecture.

## Context
- Why now: we are adopting a Pathwise-style process and need a clear, durable plan.
- Related docs:
  - /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/CONTEXT.md
  - /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/TESTING_CONTEXT.md
  - /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/BACKEND_CONTEXT.md
  - /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/MODULE_MAP.md

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Define phases and priorities for docs, testing, CI, and backend readiness.
  - Identify minimal docs to add (PROJECT_INTENT, ARCHITECTURE, CI_CHECKLIST).
  - Propose workflow integration with task briefs.
- Out of scope:
  - Code changes to gameplay or architecture.
  - New features unrelated to professionalization.

## Constraints
- MVP-first
- main.js is composition root
- Module boundaries per MODULE_MAP.md

## Risks / Unknowns
- Balancing rigor with speed (avoid slowing iteration).

## Testing
- Not applicable (docs-only).

## Files (anticipated)
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/docs/task_briefs/TASK_0_2_professionalization_roadmap_PLAN.md
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/docs/PROJECT_INTENT.md (future)
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (future)
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/docs/CI_CHECKLIST.md (future)

## Success Criteria
- Clear phased roadmap with immediate/near-term/later buckets.
- Explicit doc/process additions and their purpose.
- No architecture changes proposed.

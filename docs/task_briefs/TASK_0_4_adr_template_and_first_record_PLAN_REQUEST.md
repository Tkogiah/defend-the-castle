# Task 0.4 Plan Request — ADR Template + First Record

## Goal
- Add an ADR template and write the first ADR documenting the authoritative server + full snapshot decision.

## Context
- Why now: we are professionalizing the repo; ADRs capture durable decisions without bloating CONTEXT.
- Related docs:
  - /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/BACKEND_CONTEXT.md
  - /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Add ADR template (short, consistent format).
  - Add ADR-001 for authoritative server + full snapshots.
  - Add ADRs to the CONTEXT read order (or project map) if needed.
- Out of scope:
  - Any code changes.
  - Backend implementation work.

## Constraints
- MVP-first
- No architecture changes beyond documentation

## Risks / Unknowns
- Avoid ADRs duplicating other docs; keep them short and decision-focused.

## Testing
- Not applicable (docs-only).

## Files (anticipated)
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/docs/adr/ADR_TEMPLATE.md
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/docs/adr/ADR_001_authoritative_server_full_snapshots.md
- /Users/tkogiah/ai-workspace/defend-the-castle/CONTEXT.md (if adding ADRs to read order)

## Success Criteria
- ADR template exists and is brief.
- ADR-001 captures decision, rationale, and consequences clearly.
- No duplication of full architecture docs.

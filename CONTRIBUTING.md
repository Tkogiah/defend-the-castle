# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute
- Open an issue describing the change or bug.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Follow existing project decisions in `CONTEXT.md` and MVP scope in `specs/mvp.md`.

## Development notes
- No build system is set up yet.
- Keep architecture changes out of PRs unless explicitly discussed.

## Code style
- Prefer plain JavaScript with clear, descriptive naming.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless approved.

## Reporting issues
- Include steps to reproduce and expected behavior.
- If UI-related, include screenshots or a short clip when possible.
